Here is my project:
/price-tracker/dev_script.sh
/price-tracker/docker-compose.dev.yml
/price-tracker/docker/development/Dockerfile.dev

I ran ./dev_script.sh build success.
I run ./dev_script.sh start success.

And then I try to create the frontend by ./dev_script.sh create-frontend. I got the following errors:
â ¹ Installing packages (npm)...npm error code EACCES
npm error syscall mkdir
npm error path /workspace/frontend/node_modules/@angular
